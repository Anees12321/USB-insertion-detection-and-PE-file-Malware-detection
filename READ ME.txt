How to use - 

1. You need to make sure you have the 'classifiders&features' folder, the 'Main.py' script and the 'USB_ListenerScript' all within the same directory otherwise they will not run.

2. Run the 'USB_ListenerScript' first and then plug in a USB drive, when a USB drive has been detected being inserted it will run the 'Main.py' script provided they are in the right directory.

3. Then press the fetch contents button to fetch the files and their types within the drive. 

4. Then press the machine learning scan and select PE files (.exe, .dll, .sys etc...) from the file dialog window and press ok to run the scan.

5. Do the same with the API scan aswell (MetaDefender scan) to get them results.
